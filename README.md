# FaceMaskDetection 

This project aims to develop a face mask detection system that uses computer vision techniques to identify individuals who are not wearing face masks in public places. The system is designed to analyze live video feed from CCTV cameras and identify individuals without face masks. The system uses deep learning algorithms to detect faces

The system aims to help enforce face mask policies and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. The purpose of a face mask detection project is to contribute to public health efforts to control the spread of infectious diseases and protect individuals in public spaces.

# Precodure

There are 4 steps for building FaceMask detection model

## Face Identification
## Face Extraction
## Feature Extraction
## Training Model

we used Retina Face for detecting and extracting Face and CNN model for feature extraction and detection of face mask

# Accuracy
Model gives a accuracy of 93%
Accuracy of Retina-Face to detect faces 99%
Overall accuracy 92.07%
